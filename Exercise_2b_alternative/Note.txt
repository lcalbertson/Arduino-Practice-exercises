Both 2b and the alternative will work and in some instances it makes sense to use one method over the other.
DigitalWrite then changing the variable probably takes less clock cycles (faster) than reading the pin then changing the pin.
The difference in time is in most situations not an issue.  By using if(digitalRead(pin)) saves a global variable (or the need for a local).
